        <p>Got my first job when I was 14, working as "guardinha mirim" as we called back then. Had to go to banks and pay the bills as well collect money from people who was in debt with my employer.<br>
            At the age of 16 I worked in a beverage warehouse, I was responsible to issue the invoices.<br>
            At 18 got a job to deliver newspaper using bycicles and after that worked as finalist art assistant when I had to use Corel Draw, Photoshop and Page Maker to build magazines, newspaper, phonebooks and so on.<br>
            To not prolong too much this subject, I need to tell that I always jumped to one area of work to another with the desire of being challenged.<br></p>
            
        
        <h2 id="why">Why a software developer?</h2>

        <p>
            During all my life I had one constant love which is tecnology, so now I got the opportunity of my life as a software developer student at Trybe. I hope to get a job in IT and maybe become a instructor to pass on our knowledge to next generation as a form to consolidate what we learn everyday.<br>
